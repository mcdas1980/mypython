Exploratory Data Analsis  :EDA 

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
import seaborn as sns 

plt.plot(x,y,marker='.',linestyle='none')

plt.hist(x,bins=10) 

bins will varry how the hist will be looked , the best practice is to set the bins count as the sequare root of the x value 

num_bins = np.sqrt(x)

plt.host(x,bins=num_bins) 

Because every person shows the data diffarently it might be confusing to interpret the data based on its bins count. 

so the best one is 

Bee swarm plot
Make a bee swarm plot of the iris petal lengths. Your x-axis should contain each of the three species, and the y-axis the petal lengths. A data frame containing the data is in your namespace as df.

For your reference, the code Justin used to create the bee swarm plot in the video is provided below:

 = sns.swarmplot(x='state', y='dem_share', data=df_swing)
_ = plt.xlabel('state')
_ = plt.ylabel('percent of vote for Obama')
plt.show()

# Create bee swarm plot with Seaborn's default settings
#df.dtypes
sns.swarmplot(x='species', y = 'petal length (cm)', data = df)
# Label the axes
plt.xlabel('species')
plt.ylabel('petal length (cm)')
# Show the plot
plt.show()
